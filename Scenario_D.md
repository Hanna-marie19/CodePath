Hello Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out and expressing interest in returning to the course.

As you may have already been aware, missing coursework is non-compliance with our [course policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19), and this will result in automatic withdrawal from the class. We have provided you with an opportunity to explain the reasons for the non-submission of the coursework. However, we did not receive any response from your end, which resulted in the finality of the withdrawal from the program.

While you are no longer enrolled in the class, we are committed to supporting your learning journey. With this, we have given you lifetime access to the course material using the GitHub you used to sign up for us.

We understand that situations could get challenging, and we regret that it has come to this outcome. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Best Regards,

CodePath.org Team
