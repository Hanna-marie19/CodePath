Hello Jane,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts with us. We appreciate your interest in our program and your time and effort in building the Flix app.

We understand your disappointment with the eligibility requirements. We apologize for any confusion we may have caused.

While we love to accommodate every dedicated learner, for now, our courses are focused on students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. As an organization, we hope to expand to other locations and reach more learners.

To keep you updated on future courses or virtual events that might be available in your area, you can sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst).

We truly appreciate your efforts in the application. We encourage you to continue your learning journey.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best Regards,

CodePath.org Team
