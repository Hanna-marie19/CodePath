Hello John,

Thank you for applying to the Web Development Program. We appreciate your enthusiasm to be on the Advanced track.

However, after reviewing your application and prework, your qualifications align with the Intermediate track. Our decision is based on careful consideration as we intend to provide students with a learning environment where they can succeed without getting overwhelmed.

We encourage you to proceed with the Intermediate track to have a strong foundation in the field.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to admissions@codepath.org.

Best Regards,

CodePath.org Team
